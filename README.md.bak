CS2 Demo Downloader
A user-friendly desktop application for Windows that simplifies the process of downloading and decompressing Counter-Strike 2 match demos directly from share codes.

Features
Simple Interface: A clean, modern, and intuitive user interface designed for ease of use.

Flexible Input: Accepts both direct match share codes (e.g., CSGO-...) and full Steam run links.

Single & Batch Downloads: Download demos one by one or paste a list of share codes to process them in a batch.

Concurrent Downloads: Utilizes a multi-threaded worker system to download multiple demos simultaneously, significantly speeding up batch processing.

Efficient Processing: Downloads and decompresses files in a streamlined pipeline to save time and disk space.

Progress Tracking: Visual progress bars provide real-time feedback on resolving, downloading, and decompressing demos.

Persistent Settings: Remembers your selected download folder, so you only need to set it once.

Error Handling: Includes a 5-minute timeout on downloads and a "Retry" button for any failed attempts.

Installation
Go to the [suspicious link removed] page of this repository.

Download the latest .exe installer (e.g., CS2-Demo-Downloader-Setup-vX.X.X.exe).

Run the installer.

Note: When you run the installer for the first time, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning because this is a new application. This is expected. To proceed, simply click "More info" and then "Run anyway".
